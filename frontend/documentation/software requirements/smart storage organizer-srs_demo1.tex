\section{Introduction}
% Explain the vision and objectives. State the business need for the application and summarise the scope of the
% project.
\subsection{Vision and Objectives}
Traditional storage organization methods often rely on manual labelling and searching, leading to wasted time and frustration.
\newline
This project focuses on creating an application that will help users efficiently organize and easily locate their belongings. It aims to solve the problems associated with traditional storage methods, such as manual labelling and searching, which often result in wasted time and frustration
\newline
\newline
The objective of this project is to design and implement a system that simplifies item labelling and identification using QR codes and color coding. The key features of the system include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simplify item labeling and identification using QR codes and color coding.
    \item Enhance searchability through text and voice search functionalities.
    \item Offer potential for enhanced search accuracy using AI integration.
\end{itemize}
% got the description from the project proposal

\subsection{Project Owner}
Shamier Chandley | Dynamic Visual Technologies (dvt).

\section{User Characteristics}
% List all intended users and explain for what purpose each of them would use the system.
All of the below-mentioned users are assumed to have knowledge of operating a computer and using a smartphone. They should also have access to the internet.

\subsection{Employees}
\begin{itemize}
    % \item A person that works for dvt.
    \item A person that will regularly store, organize and label items.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{dvt Admins}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A person that we will manage the application.
    \item A person that will routinely manage both the dvt Employees.
\end{itemize}
